    <p id="aboutme">My name is Abdulla, I am 21 years old and I'm trying to be a dedicated software developer
         committed to enhancing my individual projects. 
         Fueled by a passion for coding and technology, 
         I continuously refine my skills in various programming languages 
         and frameworks. Overcoming challenges and creating innovative 
         solutions for my personal endeavors bring me immense satisfaction.
          Currently seeking opportunities in the software development field,
           I am excited about applying my evolving skill set to contribute 
           meaningfully in a professional context.(Ferman is used as an alias for my developer name)
